## Motivation

> Unlike DevUtils that you have to pay every year and the maker doesn't really listen to the audience 😡

These DevToolz are simple, easy to implement and yet helpful and should be open-sourced, shared to the whole
dev community.

## Contribution

Feel free to submit your idea (over an Issue) or your Feature PR. 

We'd love to have more and more tools under DevToolz 🚀.
